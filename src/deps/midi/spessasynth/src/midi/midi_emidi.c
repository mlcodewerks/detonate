/**
 * midi_emidi.c
 * EMIDI (Extended MIDI) track-designation scanning and filtering.
 *
 * Tracks in EMIDI-aware files carry CC 110 ("Track Designation") events
 * naming the sound cards the track is authored for.  Apogee's AudioLib
 * numbers them (audiolib/_midi.h):
 *
 *    0  General MIDI          5  Pro Audio Spectrum
 *    1  Roland Sound Canvas   6  Sound Man 16
 *    2  Sound Blaster AWE32   7  Adlib
 *    3  Wave Blaster          8  Ensoniq Soundscape
 *    4  Sound Blaster         9  Gravis Ultrasound
 *
 *  127  every card (EMIDI_ALL_CARDS, the wildcard — 0 is *not* a wildcard)
 *
 * A song built for several cards duplicates its content across tracks and
 * marks each copy with the designations it belongs to, so playing the file
 * without filtering doubles (or triples) the voices.
 *
 * A track carrying designations plays if *any* one of them names the card
 * we are: AudioLib's _MIDI_InitEMIDI latches EMIDI_IncludeTrack on the
 * first match and never clears it (its `IncludeFound` guard only lets the
 * first designation seen decide against us).  A track listing several
 * cards including ours therefore plays — matching on all of them is not
 * required, and demanding that drops parts that should sound.
 *
 * Derived from the EMIDI "clean" behavior in midi_processing's
 * midi_container::serialize_as_stream, corrected against AudioLib: that
 * implementation drops a track on its first designation outside
 * {0, 1, 127} without regard to the rest.

 * The cost is that an EMIDI file using nothing but track designations is
